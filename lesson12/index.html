          <p class="city-paragraph-1">Dell is an American multinational computer technology company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers 
            and related products and services, and is owned by it's parent company of Dell Technologies. Founded in 1984 by Michael Dell, the company is 
            one of the largest technology corporations in the world, employing more than 165,000 people in the U.S. and around the world.

            Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, 
            printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, 
            particularly its direct-sales model and its "build-to-order" or "configure to order" approach to manufacturingâ€”delivering individual PCs configured to 
            customer specifications.<br> <br>
            Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell 
            entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding 
            their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions[buzzword] for enterprise customers.</p>
