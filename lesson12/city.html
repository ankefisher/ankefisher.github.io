    <h2>Austin</h2>


      <p>Austin is the capital city of the U.S. state of Texas. Founded in 1839, it is the 11th-most populous city in the United States, 
        the fourth-most-populous city in Texas, and the second-most-populous state capital city after Phoenix, Arizona. <br> <br>
        Located in Central Texas within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways 
        and is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States.<br> <br>
        It was also the fastest growing large city in the United States in 2015 and 2016.
        As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 1, 2019 estimate, Austin had a population of 978,908,up from 790,491 at the 2010 census.
        The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austinâ€“Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, 
        which had an estimated population of 2,227,083 as of July 1, 2019, nearly an 80% increase from the year 2000.

          <h2 class="city-headline-1"> Culture</h2>
          <p class="city-paragraph-1">"Keep Austin Weird" has been a local motto for years, featured on bumper stickers and T-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting 
          Austin's eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses<br> <br>
          Annual events and Music Festivals include Eeyore's Birthday Party, Spamarama, Austin Pride Festival & Parade in August, the Austin Reggae Festival in April, 
          Kite Festival, Texas Craft Brewers Festival in September, Art City Austin in April, East Austin Studio Tour in November,
          and Carnaval Brasileiro in February. Sixth Street features annual festivals such as the Pecan Street Festival and Halloween night. 
          The three-day Austin City Limits Music Festival has been held in Zilker Park every year since 2002. Every year around the end of March 
          and the beginning of April, Austin is home to "Texas Relay Weekend."</p>

        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>The Greater Austin metropolitan statistical area had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $86 billion in 2010. Austin is considered 
        to be a major center for high tech. Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at the 
        University of Texas at Austin provide a steady source of employees that help to fuel Austin's technology and defense industry sectors. <br> <br>
        The region's rapid growth has led Forbes to rank the Austin metropolitan area number one among all big cities for jobs for 2012 in their 
        annual survey and WSJ Marketwatch to rank the area number one for growing businesses. By 2013, Austin was ranked No. 14 on Forbes' 
        list of the Best Places for Business and Careers (directly below Dallas, No. 13 on the list). As a result of the high concentration of 
        high-tech companies in the region, Austin was strongly affected by the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and subsequent bust.</p>
  
        <div class="city-grid">
        <h2 class="city-headline-1">Cuisine</h2>
        <p class="city-paragraph-1"> Austin is perhaps best known for its Texas barbecue and Tex-Mex cuisine. Franklin Barbecue is perhaps Austin's most famous barbecue restaurant; 
        the restaurant has sold out of brisket every day since its establishment. Breakfast tacos and queso are popular food items in the city; 
        Austin is sometimes called the "home of the breakfast taco." Kolaches are a common pastry in Austin bakeries due to the large Czech and German 
        immigrant population in Texas. The Oasis Restaurant is the largest outdoor restaurant in Texas, which promotes itself as the "Sunset Capital of Texas" 
        with its terraced views looking West over Lake Travis. <br> <br></p>

     <h2>Music</h2>
      <p> As Austin's official slogan is "The Live Music Capital of the World", the city has a vibrant live music scene with more music venues per capita 
      than any other U.S. city. Austin's music revolves around the many nightclubs on 6th Street and an annual film/music/interactive festival 
      known as South by Southwest (SXSW). The concentration of restaurants, bars, and music venues in the city's downtown core is a major contributor 
      to Austin's live music scene.
